# Obliterate
v 1.0

## Description
A secure file and folder deletion tool designed to be integrated with the windows context menu.

Obliterate uses a multi-threaded approach to zero-byting (filling with 0x00 bytes) a file before it is deleted.

A guide for context menu integration can be found [on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29769228).
